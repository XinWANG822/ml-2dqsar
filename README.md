Quantitatively Predicting CPIs by a kind of classical method.  
In this project, we try to predict Compound-Protein Interactions (CPIs) by multi-task learning.  

### TODO Result
1. Peptide GPCR cases  
- Combination with different physical-chemical characters and different types of fingerprints.  
- Methods Comparision: single task and one unified task.  
- Variance ratio chosen.  
- threshod SVD for structure presentation.  
- Show the parameters' patterns in different tasks.

2. _Chen_'s ADME prediction.  

3. Applied on another Protein family.
